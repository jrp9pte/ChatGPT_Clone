# Chatbot Mini Project

## Goal

Build a chatbot application using the OpenAI API, React, and Express.

## Scenario

In a world where interacting with chatbots can often be an exercise in frustration, from struggling with airline bots that fail to understand basic queries to facing tax-filing bots that seem oblivious to common sense, we set out on a mission to create a chatbot that offers a refreshing change. Leveraging the power of AI and LLMs, we aim to develop a chatbot that truly understands users, provides accurate and helpful responses, and simplifies everyday tasks. With the OpenAI API, React, and Express, we embark on a transformative journey to reshape the chatbot landscape and provide users with a reliable and intelligent virtual assistant. Say goodbye to those less-than-ideal bots.
